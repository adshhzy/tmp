Kirkpatrick's Triangular Decomposition<br>
<br>
1. Description<br>
Kirkpatrick's Triangular Decomposition is an useful method for
efficiently querying the location of a given point in a certain
polygon. In class, we have learned how to use this method to query a
location for a single polygon with interior structure. Such problem can
be apply to some real situation such as query a point in which room of
a big house. We found that whatever the polygon looks like, the method
always adds addition large triangle outside the input polygon and
triangulate all the interior structure inside of the big triangle.
Therefore, in our project, we solved the problem that there exists
multiple simple polygons, and then input a query point, and return the
polygon which contains the query point.<br>
<br>
In this project, we add a large triangle outside all polygons and use
Kirkpatrick method run the query process, finally the search structure
directed acyclic graph will be displayed for demonstration.<br>
<br>
2. Algorithm<br>
the algorithm that we implemented is the Kirkpatrick triangular
decomposition. The reference we use is the open source from Github
(https://github.com/projedi/geometry-kirkpatrick). Based on the source
code, we modify the scripts of triangulating single polygons and add
our own functions for triangulating multiple polygons inside the outer
triangle and visualizing directed acyclic graph as we query the point
location. <br>
<br>
First, we design the input and the data structure that store graphical
information, such as points, edges, polygons, and triangles. Now the
applet can get input of multiple polygons and each of them can be
triangulated separately. In this process, we also add &#8216;catch point&#8217;
function so that now we can close the polygon directly without clicking
additional button.<br>
<br>
Second, we write a new triangulation function which can simultaneously
takes the outer triangle and polygons as input to triangulate the
polygons and outer triangle. Then we use the triangulation function
provided in the reference code to triangulate the individual polygon.
The vertices, edges and triangles information are all store in the
graph data structure.<br>
<br>
Finally, we run the Kirkpatrick's triangular decomposition algorithm and visualize the directed acyclic graph (DAG). <br>
<br>
Dingwen and Hong finish the first and second part, and Zhiyang finish the third part.<br>
<br>
3. Run-Time Analysis: Our algorithm is implemented according to the
common Kirkpatrick triangular decomposition, which performs
triangulation in O(nlogn) time, builds tree in O(nlogn), query in
O(logn).<br>
<br>
4. Instructions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Left click several points inside the outer triangle, then
click button "Close Polygon". This will automatically save the polygon.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Repeat the above step for different polygons. When finish adding
polygons, click the button "Finish Adding Polyine". Then click button
"Triangulate".</li>

  </li>
  <li>After
getting triangulated polygons, click button "Find Independent Set" and
then click button "Remove Set &amp; Re-Triangulate". This will remove
the independent point set and re-triangulate the polygons. <br>
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>The query is performed by clicking arbitrary point inside the outer triangle and then click the button "Step".</li>
  <li><img style="width: 1000px; height: 556px;" alt="5" src="images/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-09%20at%203.12.20%20PM.png"></li>

  <li>Finally we will get the DAG for query the point location.<br>
